@section main_intro Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a window,
creating an OpenGL context and managing input.  It is easy to integrate into
existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

This is the documentation for version 3.1, which has [many new features](@ref news).

There is a [quick tutorial](@ref quick) for people new to GLFW, which shows how
to write a small but complete program, and guides for
[compiling GLFW](@ref compile) and
[building programs that use GLFW](@ref build).

If you have used GLFW 2.x in the past, there is a
[transition guide](@ref moving) that explains what has changed and how to update
existing code to use the new API.
