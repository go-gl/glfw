@section news_31 New features in version 3.1

@subsection news_31_cursor Custom system cursor support

GLFW now supports creating and setting custom system cursors.  They can be
created with @ref glfwCreateCursor and set with @ref glfwSetCursor.  Note that
custom cursors are only visible in normal cursor mode.


@subsection news_31_drop File drop event support

GLFW now provides a callback for receiving the paths of files dropped onto GLFW
windows.  The callback is set with the @ref glfwSetDropCallback function.


@subsection news_31_emptyevent Empty event support

GLFW now provides the @ref glfwPostEmptyEvent function for posting an empty
event from another thread to the main thread event queue, causing @ref
glfwWaitEvents to return.


@subsection news_31_framesize Window frame size query

GLFW now supports querying the size, on each side, of the frame around the
client area of a window, with @ref glfwGetWindowFrameSize.


@subsection news_31_autoiconify Multi-monitor installation support

GLFW now supports disabling auto-iconification of full screen windows with
[GLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY](@ref window_hints_wnd).  This is intended for people
building multi-monitor installations, where you need windows to stay in full
screen despite losing focus.


@subsection news_31_floating Floating windows

GLFW now supports floating windows, also called topmost or always on top, for
easier debugging, with the `GLFW_FLOATING` window hint.


@subsection news_31_charmods Character with modifiers callback

GLFW now provides a callback for character events with modifier key bits.
Unlike the regular character callback, this will report character events that
will not result in a character being input, for example if the Control key is
held down.


@subsection news_31_egl Stable EGL support

The support for EGL is now stable, successfully running on PandaBoards, Mesa,
ANGLE, Wayland, AMD EGL and others.


@section news_30 New features in version 3.0

@subsection news_30_cmake CMake build system

GLFW now uses the CMake build system instead of the various makefiles and
project files used by earlier versions.  CMake is available for all platforms
supported by GLFW, is present in most package systems and can generate
makefiles and/or project files for most popular development environments.

For more information on how to use CMake, see the
[CMake manual](http://cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html).


@subsection news_30_multiwnd Multi-window support

GLFW now supports the creation of multiple windows, each with their own OpenGL
or OpenGL ES context, and all window functions now take a window handle.  Event
callbacks are now per-window and are provided with the handle of the window that
received the event.  The @ref glfwMakeContextCurrent function has been added to
select which context is current on a given thread.


@subsection news_30_multimon Multi-monitor support

GLFW now explicitly supports multiple monitors.  They can be enumerated with
@ref glfwGetMonitors, queried with @ref glfwGetVideoModes, @ref
glfwGetMonitorPos, @ref glfwGetMonitorName and @ref glfwGetMonitorPhysicalSize,
and specified at window creation to make the newly created window full screen on
that specific monitor.


@subsection news_30_unicode Unicode support

All string arguments to GLFW functions and all strings returned by GLFW now use
the UTF-8 encoding.  This includes the window title, error string, clipboard
text, monitor and joystick names as well as the extension function arguments (as
ASCII is a subset of UTF-8).


@subsection news_30_clipboard Clipboard text I/O

GLFW now supports reading and writing plain text to and from the system
clipboard, with the @ref glfwGetClipboardString and @ref glfwSetClipboardString
functions.


@subsection news_30_gamma Gamma ramp support

GLFW now supports setting and reading back the gamma ramp of monitors, with the
@ref glfwGetGammaRamp and @ref glfwSetGammaRamp functions.  There is also @ref
glfwSetGamma, which generates a ramp from a gamma value and then sets it.


@subsection news_30_gles OpenGL ES support

GLFW now supports the creation of OpenGL ES contexts, by setting the
`GLFW_CLIENT_API` window hint to `GLFW_OPENGL_ES_API`, where creation of such
contexts are supported.  Note that GLFW *does not implement* OpenGL ES, so your
driver must provide support in a way usable by GLFW.  Modern nVidia and Intel
drivers support creation of OpenGL ES context using the GLX and WGL APIs, while
AMD provides an EGL implementation instead.


@subsection news_30_egl (Experimental) EGL support

GLFW now has an experimental EGL context creation back end that can be selected
through CMake options.


@subsection news_30_hidpi High-DPI support

GLFW now supports high-DPI monitors on both Windows and OS X, giving windows full
resolution framebuffers where other UI elements are scaled up.  To achieve this,
@ref glfwGetFramebufferSize and @ref glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback have been
added.  These work with pixels, while the rest of the GLFW API works with screen
coordinates.  This is important as OpenGL uses pixels, not screen coordinates.


@subsection news_30_error Error callback

GLFW now has an error callback, which can provide your application with much
more detailed diagnostics than was previously possible.  The callback is passed
an error code and a description string.


@subsection news_30_wndptr Per-window user pointer

Each window now has a user-defined pointer, retrieved with @ref
glfwGetWindowUserPointer and set with @ref glfwSetWindowUserPointer, to make it
easier to integrate GLFW into C++ code.


@subsection news_30_iconifyfun Window iconification callback

Each window now has a callback for iconification and restoration events,
which is set with @ref glfwSetWindowIconifyCallback.


@subsection news_30_wndposfun Window position callback

Each window now has a callback for position events, which is set with @ref
glfwSetWindowPosCallback.


@subsection news_30_wndpos Window position query

The position of a window can now be retrieved using @ref glfwGetWindowPos.


@subsection news_30_focusfun Window focus callback

Each windows now has a callback for focus events, which is set with @ref
glfwSetWindowFocusCallback.


@subsection news_30_enterleave Cursor enter/leave callback

Each window now has a callback for when the mouse cursor enters or leaves its
client area, which is set with @ref glfwSetCursorEnterCallback.


@subsection news_30_wndtitle Initial window title

The title of a window is now specified at creation time, as one of the arguments
to @ref glfwCreateWindow.


@subsection news_30_hidden Hidden windows

Windows can now be hidden with @ref glfwHideWindow, shown using @ref
glfwShowWindow and created initially hidden with the `GLFW_VISIBLE` window hint.
This allows for off-screen rendering in a way compatible with most drivers, as
well as moving a window to a specific position before showing it.


@subsection news_30_undecorated Undecorated windows

Windowed mode windows can now be created without decorations, i.e. things like
a frame, a title bar, with the `GLFW_DECORATED` window hint.  This allows for
the creation of things like splash screens.


@subsection news_30_keymods Modifier key bit masks

[Modifier key bit mask](@ref mods) parameters have been added to the
[mouse button](@ref GLFWmousebuttonfun) and [key](@ref GLFWkeyfun) callbacks.


@subsection news_30_scancode Platform-specific scancodes

A scancode parameter has been added to the [key callback](@ref GLFWkeyfun). Keys
that don't have a [key token](@ref keys) still get passed on with the key
parameter set to `GLFW_KEY_UNKNOWN`.  These scancodes will vary between machines
and are intended to be used for key bindings.


@subsection news_30_jsname Joystick names

The name of a joystick can now be retrieved using @ref glfwGetJoystickName.
