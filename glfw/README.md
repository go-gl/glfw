# GLFW

## Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL and OpenGL ES
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows and contexts, reading input, handling events, etc.

Version 3.1 is *not yet described*.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[introductory tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW
3 useful.  If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a
[transition guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to
the GLFW 3 API.

Note that a number of source files have been added or renamed in 3.1, which may
require you to update any custom build files you have.


## Compiling GLFW

See the [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) guide in
the GLFW documentation.


## Using GLFW

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide in the GLFW documentation.


## Dependencies

GLFW bundles a number of dependencies in the `deps/` directory.

 - [Khronos extension headers](https://www.opengl.org/registry/) for API
   extension symbols used by GLFW
 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://gitorious.org/tinythread/tinycthread/) for threaded
   examples
 - An OpenGL 3.2 core loader generated by
   [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for examples using modern OpenGL


## Changelog

           when a debug context had not been requested
 - Bugfix: The particles example was not linked against the threading library
 - Bugfix: The cursor was not positioned over newly created full screen windows
 - [Cocoa] Added `_GLFW_USE_RETINA` to control whether windows will use the full
           resolution on Retina displays
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Using a 1x1 cursor for hidden mode caused some screen
                   recorders to fail
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Some Core Foundation objects were leaked during joystick
                   enumeration and termination
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: One copy of each display name string was leaked
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Monitor enumeration caused a segfault if no `NSScreen` was
                   found for a given `CGDisplay`
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Modifier key events were lost if the corresponding modifier
                   bit field was unchanged
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Joystick enumeration took hundreds of ms on some systems
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: The cursor was hidden when the user resized a GLFW window
 - [Win32] Enabled generation of pkg-config file for MinGW
 - [Win32] Bugfix: Failure to load winmm or its functions was not reported to
                   the error callback
 - [Win32] Bugfix: Some keys were reported based on the current layout instead
                   of their physical location
 - [Win32] Bugfix: Maximized hidden windows were restored by `glfwShowWindow`
 - [Win32] Bugfix: Context re-creation was not triggered by sRGB hint
 - [X11] Added run-time support for systems lacking the XKB extension
 - [X11] Made GLX 1.3 the minimum supported version
 - [X11] Bugfix: The case of finding no usable CRTCs was not detected
 - [X11] Bugfix: Detection of broken Nvidia RandR gamma support did not verify
                 that at least one CRTC was present
 - [X11] Bugfix: A stale `_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK` root window property would
                 cause an uncaught `BadWindow` error
 - [X11] Bugfix: No check was made for the presence of GLX 1.3 when
                 `GLX_SGIX_fbconfig` was unavailable
 - [X11] Bugfix: The message type of ICCCM protocol events was not checked
 - [X11] Bugfix: `glfwDestroyWindow` did not flush the output buffer
 - [X11] Bugfix: Window frame interactions were reported as focus events
 - [X11] Bugfix: Workaround for legacy Compiz caused flickering during resize
 - [X11] Bugfix: The name pointer of joysticks were not cleared on disconnection
 - [X11] Bugfix: Video mode dimensions were not rotated to match the CRTC


## Contact

The official website for GLFW is [glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org/).  There you
can find the latest version of GLFW, as well as news, documentation and other
information about the project.

If you have questions related to the use of GLFW, we have a
[support forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/glfw/discussion/247562/), and the IRC
channel `#glfw` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

If you have a bug to report, a patch to submit or a feature you'd like to
request, please file it in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues) on GitHub.

Finally, if you're interested in helping out with the development of GLFW or
porting it to your favorite platform, we have an occasionally active
[developer's mailing list](https://lists.stacken.kth.se/mailman/listinfo/glfw-dev),
or you could join us on `#glfw`.
